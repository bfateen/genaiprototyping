## Launch Environment for AWS Prototypes (LEAP)

LEAP is a web-based, open-source environment that allows pre-built prototypes to be launched instantly and modified within only 7 steps. It is designed for seamless integration with existing AWS accounts, requiring no modifications to the current AWS user interface. 

This solution  enables rapid deployment of full-stack AWS prototypes through a secure web interface. The system consists of two main components:
1. A secure prototype environment installer
2. Deployable prototype templates

The environment is setup with the following these steps: 1/ User watches a short video that describes the simple setup process and basic info on CloudFormation and Amazon Bedrock model access, 2/ User requests and is granted access to an AI Model, 3/ User uploads the setup CloudFormation script which installs the web app and sets up all the necessary roles and permissions, 4/ User clicks on the URL for the web app to open it in their browser and chooses from pre-loaded prototypes, 5/ The CloudFormation stack is deployed on the backend and returns the new resources, 6/ Links to the assets are shown clearly to the user (frontend URL, API endpoint, link to Lambda function, etc.), 7/ A brief description about the generated resources and how they interact along with clickable links to 30 second videos that explain concepts (i.e. Prompt Engineering) and services (i.e. API Gateway) which creates a personalized learning path on the right side column.


### Main Features:
1.	Dynamic loading of custom-built prototypes from a GitHub repository
2.	One-click prototype deployment system for Generative AI applications
3.	Web-based interface hosted on S3 with a modern, responsive design
4.	Real-time deployment status monitoring, progress tracking and removal with cleanup
5.	Interactive architecture visualization for deployed prototypes
6.	Direct links to AWS console for deployed services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway)
7.	Cost tracking and estimation for deployed prototypes
8.	Integrated explainer system with video tutorials and documentation
9.	Persistent state management using local storage
10.	CORS-enabled API endpoints for secure cross-origin requests

The following initial custom prototypes for idea validation and MVPs will be included in the first version (to be released following AppSec review on November 15th)
- A full-stack serverless Generative AI chatbot app with a Rest API endpoint
- A ‚Äòchat with your documents‚Äô Knowledge Base web app using Cognito to secure endpoints
- A landing page that collects signups for preview access with a Gen AI prompt-flow backend plus basic analytics
- A‚Äòwizard of oz‚Äô prototype that analyzes uploaded documents with Gen AI using an Agent on Bedrock and returns an analysis. The second version of the environment includes the ability to customize the frontend using natural language for more flexibility in generating customized frontends plus the ability to continue development locally using SAM and AWS CDK.

## Security Features

While our emphasis in this solution is on building rapid prototyping capabilities, security remains a critical consideration even as we optimize for speed and simplicity. Our primary security strategy centers on securing all endpoints and on isolation ‚Äì so we will run all prototypes in dedicated sandbox AWS accounts, separate from production environments. This approach leverages AWS's strongest security boundary - account isolation - while allowing us to simplify other security controls that might otherwise create friction in the prototyping process.

We will use Coginto to secure the access to ensure:

- Only login page is publicly accessible
- Protected content requires authentication
- Error page for unauthorized access
- Proper CORS and security headers
- The Cognito JWT token received after login expires (default is 1 hour)
- The signed S3 URL generated by the Lambda function expires after 5 minutes

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Cognito User Pool with secure password policies
   - API Gateway authorization
   - IAM role least privilege principle

2. **Data Protection**
   - S3 bucket encryption
   - HTTPS only access
   - Secure parameter handling

3. **Network Security**
   - Private subnet deployment options
   - CORS configuration
   - API Gateway resource policies

To validate the security posture of prototypes created through this solution, we will follow the Content Security Review process as well as use ‚ÄòProwler‚Äô, an industry-standard automated security assessment tool that is widely used within AWS security teams. Prowler provides comprehensive scanning for misconfigurations and potential security issues, offering more reliability than manual security reviews. This automated approach helps identify subtle security gaps that could be easily overlooked during rapid prototyping phases.

While we streamline security configurations to enable rapid experimentation, we maintain vigilance over fundamental security controls. Each prototype environment ensures proper implementation of basic security features such as client-side encryption and appropriate logging configurations. These foundational security measures are non-negotiable even in prototype environments, establishing good security practices from the start.
